## What is PCA?

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique in machine learning. It transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while preserving important information.

## Why Use PCA?

1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplify complex data by reducing the number of features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that capture essential patterns.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize high-dimensional data more effectively.
4. **Noise Reduction**: Remove noise and redundancy from data.
5. **Multicollinearity Handling**: Address multicollinearity in regression models.

## How PCA Works

1. **Standardization**: Scale data to have the same magnitude.
2. **Covariance Matrix**: Compute relationships between features.
3. **Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues**: Find principal directions and magnitudes.
4. **Select Principal Components**: Choose top components based on variance.
5. **Projection**: Transform data into a lower-dimensional space.

## Choosing Components

Select the number of principal components to retain based on explained variance, balancing dimension reduction with information preservation.
